# Nexss Edit

Edit files with common editors

## Edit files

Every filetype can have own editor type. All editors are specified in the nexss programmer, however which one is used for particular language is defined in the language config file.

```sh
nexss edit filename.js # will install default editor if not there, and open it.
# if file is not specified will use "." as current folder.
```
