### Preview of Nexss Programmer GUI - Work in progress

This is preview of Nexss Programmer GUI which will be available in **PAID** version of the **Nexss Programmer 2.1**

![nexssProgrammerGUI](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53263666/72731842-c97f8e80-3b94-11ea-954a-23b541aa3ff7.png)

## How to start learning computer programming?

![nexssProgrammer-SelectTemplateExampleCLI](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53263666/72731382-ebc4dc80-3b93-11ea-9d84-5ee136ab2e33.png)

- Start **learning PROGRAMMING** within minutes with Nexss PROGRAMMER 2.0 eg. `nexss myprogram.r` OR `nexss myanotherprogram.py` **(nexss file.ext)** and it will download automatically compiler and run Your program.
- Add files from predefined templates for the languages
- Build your own tools that other people can use,
- Configurable Error handling with suggested solutions,
- Save time by using as many languages you like for the solution (combined),
- At the moment **32 programming languages** can be used in one project (and increasing) with provided templates for each language,
- Predefined/customisable solutions (nexss allow to predefine solutions for errors to fix them quickly),
- Easy to develop reusable modules and code.

## WHY

- You can start any program in seconds without anything,
- You can combine now **as many languages you want** easy eg for prototyping,
- You can use libraries which was written on old machines and combine with modern solutions,
- Save time on written automation tools **by you**!
- Write reusable modules **EASY** in as many languages you like.

Please go to the [USER_HOME_PATH]/.nexss/packages folder to grasp the idea. There are examples of the modules you can use.

## Nexss PROGRAMMER Examples

**[USER_HOME_PATH]/.nexss/packages** or `nexss pkg list`

Note: Packages will be installed with the very first run of `nexss` command in your terminal.

### TODO List (New Features)

- **MacOS** finish implementation (packages, configurations for all languages) **Work in progress**,
- **Linux** finish implementation (packages, configurations for all languages) **Work in progress**,
- Setup builders 'Any language To EXE' and 'Any module to EXE',
- More packages related to the current needs of the users,
- More tutorials and practical examples,
- Sequences/Applications with voice control,
- Global packages versioning, updates,
- Setup builders (Done on C++, C, Python) to make binaries (much faster ! even 1000x) + Compile Nexss PROGRAMMER packages to binary,
- Write Automatic Tests.

It is a great pleasure to work on the tools for everyone however it is a huge amount of work and the donations are always part of motivation which helps to move forward. There is still a lot of work to implement **Nexss PROGRAMMER** on the **Linux** and **MacOS**.
